# ANGSD

#### Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Data

ANGSD is a software for analyzing next generation sequencing data. The software can handle a number of different input types from mapped reads (BAM) to imputed genotype probabilities (BEAGLE). Most methods take genotype uncertainty into account, instead of calling genotypes. This is especially useful for low and medium depth data.

This is a non-official repo of ANGSD! If you are looking for the latest updates or version, please check the official webpage [here](http://popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Main_Page). This version has slight changes in the Makefile so that, by default, the inbreeding version is compliled.
